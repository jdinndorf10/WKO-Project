As part of the comprehensive approach to creating whole kids, the Outreach Specialists also address many of the social factors that improve families’ heath. During the home visits, we assist parents to continue or further their education; learn the skills necessary to improve the skills needed to seek and sustain gainful employment; obtain adequate housing and childcare; and budget their resources wisely. The Outreach Specialists create individualized Family Service Plans with the parent(s) or guardians to direct and track the family’s progress. Home visits, as part of the Family Enhancement Program, vary in number and frequency and can continue for as long as the family needs our services and shows progress toward their goals.
