The Family Enhancement Program focuses on health and child developmental needs of families with young children. Many of the families who participate in this program have experienced domestic violence, abuse/neglect, or have children who have developmental delays. All of the families who participate in our prenatal Resource Mothers Program (RMP) transfer to the Family Enhancement Program for continued services that are more expansive than the childbirth and well-baby education offered in the RMP.
