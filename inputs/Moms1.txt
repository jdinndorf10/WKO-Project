The moms who are seen in the WKO home visitation programs can often feel isolated and overwhelmed. Through the Moms Day Out program, WKO provides relief from the day-to-day pressures of parenting small children, while also giving moms a chance to gather together to share their stories and support each other. Through the activities, the moms have the opportunity to learn about various topics such as child development, self-empowerment, healthy cooking and budgeting. There is also lots of time for fun and laughter, art projects and make overs too!
