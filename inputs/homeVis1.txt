Families are visited in their homes for as long as their needs dictate and they show progress on their individual family goals. Visits are schedule as often as twice per week and as seldom as once per month – for as long as the family needs support. This provides WKO the ability to see families though to a place of healthy interdependence within their communities. Many families that begin their services during pregnancy are followed more intensely and over an extended period, as their need for education, support, resources, parenting skills or immediate crisis intervention dictate. Utilizing this responsive, integrated approach, and in conjunction with efforts to network with the family’s individual circles of support, Whole Kids Outreach programs yield more comprehensive, successful, positive and lasting changes for the family members.
