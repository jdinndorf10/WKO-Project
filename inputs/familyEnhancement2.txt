Through the Family Enhancement Program, parents learn skills to raise healthy children and families receive help to successfully navigate their daily lives. The children obtain tools to help ready them for school. They learn such skills as using words (rather than acting out) to communicate their needs, and how to cooperate and play safely. Outreach Specialists also work with families during crises episodes to help teach problem-solving skills, which reduce the negative impact on the family that such disruptions can cause.
