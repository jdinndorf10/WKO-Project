The Center stands as a tangible and bold reminder of how the health and wellbeing of families with young children must be a communityâ€™s priority if it is to be healthy and prosperous. The Center allows WKO to provide culturally sensitive, high quality programs for the service area through myriad activities. By decreasing social and geographic isolation and providing opportunities to create community, families can support each other as they form and nurture healthy families.
