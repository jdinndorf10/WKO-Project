In the Maternal-Child Visiting Nurse Program, WKO implements the Nurses For Newborns model, which was developed in St. Louis, Missouri. WKOâ€™s Registered Nurses visit expectant and new parents to help ensure that pregnant women receive appropriate prenatal care and health education. By working with the Outreach Specialists, physicians and other community service providers and resources, the nurses provide a service in areas that are unique to the region. The WKO Registered Nurses are experienced Labor and Delivery/Pediatric nurses. They not only teach well-baby care, but help identify potential medical and developmental issues so that those needs can be addressed as early as possible, giving infants the best start in life possible.
