WKO annually hosts two family community events – the Fall Family Fun Day and the Spring Festival/Easter Egg Hunt. Check back to learn of details as these events are scheduled – all in the community are welcome. Interested families may also call the WKO Center to obtain details. Those interested in volunteering for either of these events should contact Center Director Stacia Moe.
