The length of any given volunteer experience varies from an hour to a whole week. Volunteers are welcomed onto the WKO property throughout the year for a variety of activities. Each volunteer is acclimated to the expectations of the assigned tasks through a thorough orientation. This orientation also helps connect the service project with the overall mission of WKO, along with Godâ€™s global mission for our world.
