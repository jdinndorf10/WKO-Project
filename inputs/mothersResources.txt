The Resource Mothers Program is a service to help prepare expectant parents for childbirth. Experienced women from the community serve as WKO Outreach Specialists and visit expectant parents in their homes. These committed women, who are trained as childbirth educators, help ensure that women receive adequate prenatal care and how to care for their newborn.
