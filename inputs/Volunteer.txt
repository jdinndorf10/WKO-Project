The WKO Volunteer Program provides an opportunity for volunteers to participate in “mission” as opposed to an assortment of fragmented odd jobs. Volunteers are recruited from schools, established youth and community groups, and through the many relationships WKO has forged with families, businesses and agencies throughout the country.
