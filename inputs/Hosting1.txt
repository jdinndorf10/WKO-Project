The WKO Center is a great place to hold group or club meetings (e.g., Scouts, Rotary, etc.) birthday parties, family reunions, weddings, and other celebrations. WKO also partners with the Missouri Conservation Department to offer fishing days for area school children and other groups to enjoy our stocked pond.
