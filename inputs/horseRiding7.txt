Private and Small Group Lessons: Private and small group riding lessons are available throughout the week and on Saturdays. All level riders and all disciplines are welcome. Students can improve skills for horse shows or improve riding and horse handling skills for the sheer pleasure of spending time with either their own horse or one of the great WKO school horses.
