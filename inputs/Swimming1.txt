From mid-May through mid-September the beautiful swimming pool at the Center is open for private and group water safety and swimming lessons. The Camp Whole Kids campers participate in daily group lessons, taught by qualified instructor(s). WKO also hosts the Senior Aquatics Program provided by Whole Health Outreach during August and September. The pool is also available for lease by private parties. Please contact us info@wholekidsoutreach.org if you would like to participate or help sponsor this program.
